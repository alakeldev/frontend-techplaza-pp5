# Project

In this section I will detail the purpose and goals of the project, as well as the project management methodologies used throughout the development process.

## Objective

The objective of the Techplaza platform is to provide users with a seamless and engaging online experience through a comprehensive website that includes various pages and applications. The platform aims to offer a user-friendly interface for both registered and non-registered users, enabling them to access essential features and services effortlessly.

## Site User Goal

Users of the Techplaza platform may have various goals. They might want to manage their tasks efficiently, check the weather for different locations, play engaging games, or create and share community cards. Additionally, they may simply wish to interact with the community and explore the diverse features offered by the platform.

## Site Owner Goal

The goal of the Techplaza platform owner is to create a user-friendly and engaging online environment that caters to a wide range of user needs. By offering a variety of applications and features, the platform aims to attract and retain users, fostering a vibrant and interactive community. Additionally, the site owner seeks to continuously improve the platform based on user feedback and technological advancements, ensuring a high-quality experience for all users.

## Target Audience

The Techplaza platform is designed for a diverse audience, including:

- Individuals: Users looking for a comprehensive platform to manage tasks, check weather updates, play games, and create community cards.
- Professionals: Those who want to network, share their professional information, and engage with a community of like-minded individuals.

# Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. It allows teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver valuable features incrementally. In this project, we follow Agile principles to enhance productivity and ensure successful project delivery.

- User Stories and Github Issues: I utilized Github issues to create detailed user stories for my project. Each user story included essential components such as story points, acceptance criteria, and associated tasks.These user stories were tracked either on the Kanban board or within the issues themselves.
- Kanban Board for Prioritization: The Github Kanban board played a crucial role in managing my project. User stories were assigned to specific issues, allowing me to define clear goals and priorities. Labels were used to further categorize and prioritize user stories within the Kanban board.

Project Sections: my project was organized into the following sections:

- To-do: User stories awaiting implementation.
- In-progress: Ongoing work.
- Done: Completed tasks.
- Won‚Äôt-do: Items were defined as future features.

Sprint Planning with totla (9) Milestones:

- I structured the work into sprints using milestones.
- Each sprint had well-defined objectives.

The Techplaza platform features a straightforward and user-friendly site structure to minimize confusion. The main navigation bar and footer navigation are consistently present on every page, ensuring easy access to site navigation.

- Non-authenticated users have restricted access to certain pages, applications and functionalities, which is reflected in the dynamic state of the navigation menus. Specifically, non-logged-in users can only access the Home, About, Services, Contact, Log-in, Register, and Forgot Password pages/processes.

- Authenticated users, on the other hand, have full access to all the pages available to non-authenticated users, as well as all application pages. Additionally, they have access to functionalities such as log-out, delete, and update/edit.

## Colour Scheme

The color scheme has been meticulously curated to enhance the user experience. The chosen colors prioritize cleanliness, reliability, readability, stability, and depth, all while avoiding any overwhelming elements.

![Techplaza Colour Scheme](src/assets/readme/techplaza-colour-scheme.png)

## Typography

The website employs the Nunito Sans font, sourced from the Google Fonts library, consistently applied across all components to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing design. Additionally, the sans-serif font is used as a fallback option.

### Browser Tests


### Lighthouse Tests

## Bugs

A number of bugs presented themselves during the Techplaza platform development process. Most of these bugs were resolved, but unfortunately due to time constraints, some of them weren't. This section will list the resolved and unresolved bugs.

### Resolved

- During the development of the project‚Äôs front-end, I encountered numerous bugs and errors. These issues sometimes originated from the front-end and other times from the back-end. Below are some images of the resolved issues:

- ![bug1](src/assets/readme/bug1.png)
- ![bug2](src/assets/readme/bug2.png)
- ![bug3](src/assets/readme/bug3.png)
- ![bug4](src/assets/readme/bug4.png)
- ![bug5](src/assets/readme/bug5.png)
- ![bug6](src/assets/readme/bug6.png)

### Unresolved

- There is an ongoing issue with the Snake Game application on Microsoft Edge. Users are unable to start and play the game directly using the keyboard keys (W, S, A, D). To resolve this, users need to refresh the browser page before pressing the ‚ÄúStart Game‚Äù button. Without refreshing, the game does not respond to these keys. This issue has been investigated, but a solution has not yet been found. Notably, this problem does not occur on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, where users can access and play the game without needing to refresh the page. In these browsers, the game responds correctly to the (W, S, A, D) keys.

# Deployment

This section is a written guide on how to deploy a front-end React application to Heroku.

## Project Deployment via Heroku

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)

2. A new repository was created using 'Code-Instutute-Org/ci-full-template'.

3. A meaningful name was given to my new repository and I selected 'Create Repository'.

4. inside the created repo select the 'Code' button above the file list on the right hand side.

5. Ensure HTTPS is selected and click the clipboard on the right of the URL to copy it.

6. Open VS-code, creat new project folder, open the terminal, On the terminal type "git clone", then paste the copied url and press 'Enter'.

7. One the repo cloned, run the terminal command `npx create-react-app . --use-npm` to install React

8. After it has finished installing run the command `npm start` to check the app is working

9. Add a Procfile in the root directory

10. Add the following code into the Procfile - `web: serve -s build`

11. In the root package.json file in the scripts section, add the following code - `"heroku-prebuild": "npm install -g serve"`

12. Version control was used throughout the project using the following commands in the terminal:

    - git add . OR git add "file name" - to stage the changes and get them ready for being committed to the local repo.
    - git commit -m "Description of the update" - to save the change and commit the change to the local repo
    - git push origin main - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repo.

13. Log-in or sign-up to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and open the dashboard

14. Click on the 'New' button to add a new app

15. Name the app (it must be unique) and choose a region closest to your location

16. Click the 'Create app' button to create the app

17. Once the app is created, click the deploy tab on the app menu

18. Scroll down to deployment method and click the GitHub option

19. Make sure your profile is selected and search for the React GitHub repository name

20. Once the correct repository appears below the searchbar - click the 'Connect' button

21. Once the repository is connected, click the 'Deploy branch' button - make sure the master / main branch is selected

22. Optional - view the build logs as the app builds

23. If the build is successful, click the 'Open app' button to view the deployed app on Heroku
